## 👋 Welcome

**Curious-Explorer** is my personal space to track, understand, and celebrate my journey into tech.  
I’m not a developer yet, but I’m building my foundation one step at a time and learning by doing.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this repository

This repo acts as my digital journal.  
Whenever I learn something—big or small—I write it down in simple words that make sense to me.

You’ll find everything from:
- 🐙 How Git & GitHub works
- 💻 Basic programming concepts
- ⌨️ Command-line tricks
- ☁️ API Management concepts (Proxies, Flows, Policies)
- 🛡️ API Security patterns (OAuth, API Keys)
- 📝 Notes from videos, courses, and tutorials
- 🔎 Random curiosities I bump into along the way

**If it helps me understand tech, it goes here.**

---

## 📚 What’s inside

- ✏️ **Beginner-friendly notes** on tools, concepts, and workflows
- 🧠 **“Aha!” moments** when things finally make sense
- 🗂️ **Organized learnings** from tutorials and real-world practice
- 🧪 **Mini-projects & experiments** as I try out new ideas
- 💭 **Reflections** on what felt easy, what didn’t, and how I got unstuck
- 🔧 **Mistakes and fixes**—because they’re part of the process

---

## 🌱 Why I’m doing this

- To track my **progress**, no matter how small
- To **understand deeply** by writing things in my own words
- To **build confidence** in an industry that once felt overwhelming
- To **stay curious**, consistent, and committed

## 🧡 A note to myself  
> *“Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.”* — Arthur Ashe

This repo is proof that you don’t need to be an expert to start documenting your journey.  
If you’re new to tech too: welcome, you’re in good company.  
And to my future self: look how far you’ve come 👣
