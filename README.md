## 👋 Welcome
**Curious-Explorer** is my personal space to track, understand, and celebrate my journey into tech.  
I’m building my foundation one step at a time and learning by doing.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this repository
This repo acts as my **Second Brain**.  
Whenever I learn something—big or small—I write it down in simple words that make sense to me.

**Topics I explore here:**
* 🐙 **Git & GitHub:** Branching strategies, PRs, and commit hygiene.
* ☁️ **API Management:** Proxies, Flows, Policies, and Gateway logic.
* 🛡️ **Security:** OAuth 2.0 flows, JWT validation, and mTLS.
* 💻 **CLI & Scripting:** Bash tricks and automation.
* 📝 **Theory:** Notes from courses, documentation, and "Aha!" moments.

> **"If it helps me understand tech, it goes here."**

## 🔗 Connected Ecosystem
This repository is the *theory*. To see the *practice*, check out my lab:

### [🧪 Apigee-Lab](https://github.com/SunnyJayaRaj/Apigee-Lab)
My hands-on technical portfolio where I implement these concepts into real Enterprise API Proxies (JWT, Caching, FaultRules).

## 🧡 A note to myself  
> *“Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.”* — Arthur Ashe

This repo is proof that you don’t need to be an expert to start documenting your journey.  
If you’re new to tech too: welcome, you’re in good company.  
And to my future self: look how far you’ve come 👣
