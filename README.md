## 👋 Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to "curious-explorer" — my personal space to track, reflect on, and celebrate my journey into the world of tech. 
I’m not a developer (yet!), and while I come from a partially technical background, I’m here to explore, learn, and grow — one step at a time.

## 🎯 What's this repository for?

This repository is like a digital journal where I document everything I learn while navigating through GitHub, programming, tools, concepts, and anything else that catches my interest in the tech space.

Whether it’s something simple like learning how to clone a repository or complex like understanding how the internet works — I’m putting it here, in my own words.

## 🌱 Why I'm doing this

I created this repository for a few reasons:
- To keep a **record of progress** — even the small wins matter!
- To **make sense of what I learn** by writing it in my own words
- To **build confidence** in a space that once felt intimidating
- And most importantly, to **stay curious**

## 🧡 A note to myself (and maybe you too)

> “Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.” – Arthur Ashe

This repo is proof that you don’t need to be an expert to start sharing.  
So if you're also new to tech, welcome! You’re not alone.  
And if you’re my future self looking back — hey, look how far you’ve come 👣
